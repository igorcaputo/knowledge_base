JCore is divided into modules. This is good because although the product as a whole can become big and
meet various kinds of needs, your project must declare and use only what it really need. This is also good
for JCore's evolution because the evolution of a module does not impact another module which it does
not depend.

The Core module has frameworks and utilities reused by other modules. For example, logging and dependency
injection features are useful to any module. Being small frameworks, they are declared in the Core module
in order to be shared.
